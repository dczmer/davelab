# DaveLab 01 - Developer Productivity

## Objective

Gentle walk-through of some of the topics that _I_ consider to be crucial for developer productivity.

## Overview


## Contents

- [ZSH Configuration](./01_zsh-configuration/README.md) - How to configure your `zsh` shell into something that makes it comfortable for adopting a command-line-centric workflow.
- [Using the Shell](./02_using-the-shell/README.md) - How to accomplish common daily tasks by combining commands, some of the most useful, general commands, and some real world examples.
- [Basic Shell Scripting](./03_basic-shell-scripting/README.md) - You can do anything from the command line. And anything you can do from the command line, you can automate with a shell script.
- [`tmux`](./04_tmux/README.md) - Manage and wrangle multiple terminal sessions into layouts and re-attach to your session, without losing changes, if you close your terminal.
- Feedback loops
- Diagramming
- Personal Projects and Continuous Learning

Extra:
- Modal text editing
- Window managers and interacting with windows efficiently
- Linux as your daily driver
    - the terminal sections are for daily engineering tasks; this section would be for common system administration and management basics (how do i connect to wifi, etc.)
