# DaveLab 01 - Developer Productivity

## Overview

Developer productivity and developer experience are complex and broad topics. These sections cover a few of the things that, I think, provide a solid bedrock for improving the way you work with your computer and your code.

## Contents

- [ZSH Configuration](./01_zsh-configuration/README.md) - How to configure your `zsh` shell into something that makes it comfortable, visually appealing, and easier to use.
- (WIP) [Using the Shell](./02_using-the-shell/README.md) - How to accomplish common daily tasks by combining commands, some of the most useful, general commands, and some real world examples.
- (WIP) [Basic Shell Scripting](./03_basic-shell-scripting/README.md) - You can do anything from the command line. And anything you can do from the command line, you can automate with a shell script.
- (WIP) [`tmux`](./04_tmux/README.md) - Manage and wrangle multiple terminal sessions into layouts and re-attach to your session, without losing changes, if you close your terminal.

TODO:
- Feedback loops
- Diagramming
- Personal Projects and Continuous Learning
- Modal text editing
- Window managers and interacting with windows efficiently
- Linux as your daily driver
    - the terminal sections are for daily engineering tasks; this section would be for common system administration and management basics (how do i connect to wifi, etc.)
