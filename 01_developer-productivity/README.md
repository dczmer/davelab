# DaveLab 01 - Developer Productivity

## Overview

Developer productivity and developer experience are complex and broad topics. These sections cover a few of the things that, I think, provide a solid bedrock for improving the way you work with your computer and your code.

## Contents

- [ZSH Configuration](./01_zsh-configuration/README.md) - How to configure your `zsh` shell into something that makes it comfortable, visually appealing, and easier to use.
- (WIP) [Using the Shell](./02_using-the-shell/README.md) - How to accomplish common daily tasks by combining commands, some of the most useful, general commands, and some real world examples.
- (WIP) [Basic Shell Scripting](./03_basic-shell-scripting/README.md) - You can do anything from the command line. And anything you can do from the command line, you can automate with a shell script.
- [`tmux`](./04_tmux/README.md) - Manage and wrangle multiple terminal sessions into layouts and re-attach to your session, without losing changes, if you close your terminal.

<summary>TODO: topics I'd like to add to this module:</summary>

- Feedback loops and exploratory programming
- Regex 101
- Personal Projects and Continuous Learning:
    * isolation and experimentation
    * using docker for development (dependencies as containers and how to work with projects on isolated containers)
    * why you should learn about C and make in 2025
    * prototype vs. porfolio project vs. actual product
- Modal text editing (not a tutorial on vim, an explanation of modal text editing, using vim as an example):
    * A sensible `vimrc` starting file and explanation
    * How to open, edit, move around, and exit; TLDR: I have to use vim for one thing, what's the minimum I need to know?
    * What is modal text editing?
    * Other modal text editors
    * Combining zsh line-editor with vim, and zsh vim keybindings
- Window managers and interacting with windows efficiently:
    * Keep your hands on the home-row of the keyboard
    * Tiling, stacking, cascading
    * Pinning or hot-keying most used windows (one key to get to terminal, editor, browser)
    * Automation and customization
- Linux as your daily driver
    - the terminal sections are for daily engineering tasks; this section would be for common system administration and management basics (how do i connect to wifi, etc.)
    - TLDR overview of memory and process management concepts
