## Overview

Short, guided crash-courses for important every day skills.

Each course is made of a small number of short sections (around 20 minutes each).

Each section includes a `README.md` file with the course material and any relevant source code or resource files.

These lessons are intended to be interactive - work along in your terminal and do the examples as you read.

These short chapters can't teach you everything you need to be an expert. They will only cover the enough to get you off the ground, and give you an idea of how/why the topic is useful to you.

## Navigating the Chapters

This project is structured as a `git` repo, intended to be hosted on a platform where you can easily view `README.md` files in a web browser (like `github`).

Clone this repository so you have a local copy to work in. In your shell, navigate to the directory for each chapter as you go.

The chapters are sorted numerically. Start at chapter '01' and continue in order.

Each chapter has a `README.md` file with the course material, as well as one or more other example files. This means you can read the source material in the browser, via `github` UI, while you work in a terminal. Try putting your browser on one side of your desktop, and your terminal on the other side, so they both take up exactly half of the screen.

Each section will briefly cover the material, then explain how you can try it out and experiment.
