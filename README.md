# davelab

[davelab!](https://dczmer.github.io/davelab/)


Documentation site made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static-site generator, deployed automatically to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Using [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme) color scheme for theming.

Github Pages was able to deploy the entire project as a static site with no changes or configuration on my part! Except, well I didn't like the colors or the navigation menu. So I created an entire site from scratch with hand-rolled CSS and no JavaScript.
