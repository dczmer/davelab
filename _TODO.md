first, i just want to finish the breadth of the content i want to cover.
this isn't really where i want it yet.
the first course is pretty good, but the others lack interactivity and the way information is presented and grouped doesn't make a lot of sense. some of it just reads like a raw dump of random bits of information.

TODO:

- imagemagick script to optimize images:
  * `mogrify avif *.png`
- template thing to automatically set the image sizes from the file metadata...
- grunt/make to minify+concat css, optimize imgs, bundle install, bundix, etc.
- collapse TOCs when on mobile view
- create custom collections_dir "courses"
- dynamic menu, course navigation (up/down/contents/next/prev)
- light mode?
- license file:
  * properly credit:
