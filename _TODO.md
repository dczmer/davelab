## Site TODO:

- inline the 'developer experience' folder and flatten to just one category
- learn jekyll or astro to work on local version of github pages:
    * use `_drafts` to keep WIP pages; accessible in dev server but not in site
    * setup custom actions to build and publish the site
- rework each page into static site; update text, formatting, headings accordingly
- create a site layout that makes it easy to navigate the course three effectively:
    * and responsive for people who keep their browser on 1/2 of the screen ;)
    * no js, or no build/lib js... maybe one web component for fun
- more examples and images, better test/example data

## Things I'd Like to Cover Someday

- Diagramming - Quickly and effectively map out your ideas and share them with others.
- Every-Day "git-fu" - Don't be afraid of using `git` at the command line. Learn some useful tricks, like how to recover from a bad merge or rebase without abandoning your branch.
- Regex 101 - Just the basics, and some words of caution on how and where you apply this.
- Feedback Loops - Engineering involves experimentation and repeated trial-and error. Minimize the time between when you make a change and you observe it's effects.
- Modal Text Editing - Why do some people use `vim` from the command line when `vscode` exists? Why does everything, including `vscode`, have "vim" keybindings?
- Isolation and Dependencies for Developers - What is isolation? Why do you want it? What tools and techniques can you use to manage dependencies and isolation?
- Type Systems and Type Theory
- Functional Programming Concepts
- "Systems Thinking"
- Linux as Your Daily Driver
