# Basic Scripting

## Requirements

If you are on Mac, then you should [install Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). This is your best option for installing and managing software outside of the app store.

Many of the commands and programs used in this chapter are from the `coreutils` project. On a Linux system, these may already be installed in your base system. If they are not, then you should be able to install them with your system package manager.

```zsh
brew install coreutils
```
