# Using the Shell

{: .warning }
This module is still WIP and not ready for review.
<br>
I plan to re-organize and edit this content a bit more, because some sections just feel like random collections of facts instead of cohesive groups of related topics.
<br>
This module is also not as 'interactive' as I would like. I plan to add one more chapter at the end with a guided "lab" that will give some practice with the things that are covered here.
<br>
I'm also still collecting generally useful 'one-liners' to include in the last section, but I might just merge that into the "lab".

## Overview

By the end of this module you will be familiar with a hand-full of the most common and useful shell commands for daily tasks, how to combine them together into 'one-liners' to complete a task, and we'll see some real world examples.

## Requirements

If you are on Mac, then you should [install Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). This is your best option for installing and managing software outside of the app store.

Many of the commands and programs used in this chapter are from the `coreutils` project. On a Linux system, these may already be installed in your base system. If they are not, then you should be able to install them with your system package manager.

```zsh
brew install coreutils
```
