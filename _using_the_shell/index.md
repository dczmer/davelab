# Using the Shell

{: .warning }
This module is still WIP and not ready for review.
<br>
I plan to re-organize and edit this content a bit more, because some sections just feel like random collections of facts instead of cohesive groups of related topics.
<br>
This module is also not as 'interactive' as I would like. I plan to add one more chapter at the end with a guided "lab" that will give some practice with the things that are covered here.
<br>
I'm also still collecting generally useful 'one-liners' to include in the last section, but I might just merge that into the "lab".

## Overview

By the end of this module you will be familiar with a hand-full of the most common and useful shell commands for daily tasks, how to combine them together into 'one-liners' to complete a task, and we'll see some real world examples.
